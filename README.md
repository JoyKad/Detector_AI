# 🧠 AI-Generated Text Detector (Literary Style)

This notebook demonstrates how to build a machine learning model to classify literary texts as either human-written or generated by large language models (LLMs).

## 📂 Dataset

We use the [**human-or-ai-littexts** dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/JoyKad/human-or-aI-littexts) hosted on Hugging Face.

### Dataset Info:
- **Name:** `JoyKad/human-or-aI-littexts`
- **Size:** 15,759 samples
- **Labels:** `0` = Human-written, `1` = AI-generated
- **Language:** Russian
- **Text Length:** 300–1000 words
